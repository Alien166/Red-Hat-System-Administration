# Chapter 13: Archiving and Transferring Files

## Introduction

In Red Hat, archiving and transferring files are essential tasks for managing data efficiently. Whether you're backing up important files, transferring data between systems, or compressing large directories for storage or transmission, mastering these techniques is crucial for system administrators.

## Tar

**Tar** is a command-line utility used for archiving files and directories into a single file. It stands for "tape archive" and is commonly used in Linux environments for bundling files together.

### Basic Usage

To create a tar archive:

```bash
tar -cvf archive.tar files...
To extract files from a tar archive:

tar -xvf archive.tar
Options
-c: Create a new archive.
-v: Verbose mode (displays progress).
-f: Specifies the filename of the archive.
Compression
To reduce the size of archived files, you can compress them using utilities like gzip or bzip2.

Gzip
gzip archive.tar

gzip archive.tar
bzip2 archive.tar

Secure Copy (SCP)
SCP is a secure file transfer protocol that allows files to be transferred between hosts securely over a network.
scp source_file destination_file

Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)
SFTP provides a secure way to transfer files between systems over an encrypted SSH connection.
sftp username@hostname
rsync
rsync is a powerful utility for efficiently transferring and synchronizing files between systems. It only transfers the parts of files that have changed, reducing bandwidth usage
