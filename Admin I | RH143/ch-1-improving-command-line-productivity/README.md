## Key Concepts and Commands

### Command History
- `history`: View previously executed commands.
- `!n`: Execute the nth command in the history list.
- `!!`: Execute the last command again.

### Command Aliases
- `alias ll='ls -la'`: Create an alias `ll` for the command `ls -la`.

### Command Completion
- Tab completion: Press Tab to auto-complete file names and commands.

### Text Processing
- `grep 'pattern' file`: Search for a pattern within a file.
- `sed 's/old/new/g' file`: Replace occurrences of a pattern within a file.
- `awk '{print $1}' file`: Print the first column of a file.

### File Management
- `find /path -name 'filename'`: Search for files by name.
- `locate filename`: Quickly find files by name.
- `xargs`: Build and execute command lines from standard input.
- `sort file`: Sort lines in a file.
- `uniq`: Report or filter out repeated lines.
- `cut -d',' -f1 file`: Extract sections from each line of files.
- `paste file1 file2`: Merge lines of files.

### Shell Scripting
- `#!/bin/bash`: Specify the script interpreter.
- Variables: `VAR=value`
- Conditional statements: `if`, `then`, `else`, `fi`
- Loops: `for`, `while`, `do`, `done`

### `screen` and `tmux`
- `screen`: Terminal multiplexer that allows you to manage multiple terminal sessions.
- `tmux`: Terminal multiplexer with more features and flexibility than `screen`.
- Commands:
  - `screen -S session_name`: Start a new screen session.
  - `screen -ls`: List all screen sessions.
  - `screen -r session_name`: Reattach to a screen session.
  - `tmux new -s session_name`: Start a new tmux session.
  - `tmux ls`: List all tmux sessions.
  - `tmux attach -t session_name`: Attach to a tmux session.
